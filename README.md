# streamsx.shell

The [Shell toolkit for IBM Streams](https://github.com/IBMStreams/streamsx.shell) allows applications to execute Linux shell commands and pipelines as Streams operators:

* lines of text consumed from an operator's input tuples are written to a command's STDIN input

* lines of text read from the command's STDOUT and STDERR output are produced as the operator's output tuples

For the toolkit's documentation, please see [http://ibmstreams.github.io/streamsx.shell/](http://ibmstreams.github.io/streamsx.shell/).

For the toolkit's source code, please see [https://github.com/IBMStreams/streamsx.shell/](https://github.com/IBMStreams/streamsx.shell/).
